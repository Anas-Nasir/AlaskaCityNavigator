                <h2>Overview of the city and population</h2>
                <p>
                    Sitka, Alaska, located on Baranof Island in the Southeast Panhandle, is a city with a population of approximately 8,600 as of the 2020 Census. 
                    Founded as a Russian trading post in the late 18th century, Sitka played a key role in the transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States 
                    in 1867. Today, it boasts a unique blend of Russian colonial heritage and Tlingit culture, evident in 
                    landmarks like the Russian Orthodox Cathedral and the Sitka National Historical Park. The cityâ€™s economy, 
                    once heavily reliant on fishing, now includes tourism, government services, and local businesses, 
                    contributing to a higher-than-average income level compared to the rest of the state.
                </p>

                <h2>Classification of Sitka</h2>
                <p>
                    Sitka is classified as a city with a mix of urban and rural characteristics.
                    While it has urban amenities such as schools, hospitals, and shopping centers, 
                    it is surrounded by a largely rural and rugged environment. 
                    The blend of developed areas with natural landscapes gives Sitka a unique combination of both urban and rural qualities.
                </p>

                <h2>Average income in comparison to the state</h2>
                <p>
                    In Sitka, the average income level is generally higher than the Alaska state average. 
                    This is partly due to the higher cost of living in Sitka, which influences income levels. 
                    While exact figures can vary, Sitka's median household income tends to be above the statewide median,
                    reflecting the city's economic conditions and higher cost of living. For the most accurate and up-to-date income data, 
                    checking recent reports from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or local economic studies would be useful.
